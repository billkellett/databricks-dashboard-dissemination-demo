# databricks-dashboard-dissemination-demo

This notebook demonstrates shows how to extract a dashboard from Databricks and share it three different ways:

1. By creating a manual Download link
2. By periodically running the dashboard and automatically loading it to an external web site
3. By periodically running the dashboard and automatically sending it as an email attachment

These techniques are useful when you want to:
- Avoid keeping a cluster running for long periods of time in order to serve dashboards
- Disseminate dashboards to users who cannot log in to Databricks

To run this demo, import the notebook from  https://github.com/billkellett/databricks-dashboard-dissemination-demo/blob/main/notebooks/dashboard_dissemination_demo.dbc
